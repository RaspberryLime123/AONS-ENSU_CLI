#psuedo code for AONS-ENSUcliver

call:
C:\Windows\system32> AONS-ENSU_CLIv.bat "C:\game folder path" "game name" "D/N"

only use D or N (case insensitive?). program will only use Dsound or nonDsound 
update.zip

The update.zip must be in the installation folder, and D or N must be
specified. I'm cutting out the annoying detection code. It doesn't work for a 
cli util anyways.

all other operation should be the same, minus the lack of feedback.

# AONS-ENSU
 A batch file tool to automate the process of updating old ONScripter-EN executables. 
 
 This batch file requires a zip archive with the necessary contents to update the Old ONS-EN installation. Get one from kaisernet.org
 This should run on any windows system, post Windows 2000. 
 
DEPENDENCIES:
unzip.exe (https://sourceforge.net/projects/infozip/files/UnZip%206.x%20%28latest%29/UnZip%206.0/)

This is a commandline utility, and is called like so
AONS-ENSU_CLIv2.0 "[full game folder  path]" "[name of game]" [d or n]

all three flags are MANDATORY. the quotes are not mandatory, but if the game folder path, or the game name have spaces in them, please surround them with quotes.

 other than it being a commandline utility without even a TUI, this is the same as AONS-ENSU
 
 This script does not automatically rename the updated ONS-EN executable
